End to end code for the email spam classifier project
Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning project designed to detect spam emails.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean, preprocess, and analyze email content.
The dataset consists of labeled emails marked as either spam or ham (not spam).
Text data is vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency).
A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained for classification due to its efficiency with text.
The trained model is serialized using pickle and saved for later use.
A simple and interactive Streamlit app allows users to test new emails live.
Users input email text, and the app instantly predicts whether it's spam or not.
The project showcases the application of machine learning in filtering unwanted messages.
It also emphasizes the importance of email security and automation in modern communication.
